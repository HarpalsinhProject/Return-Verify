## Original User Request:
Project Prompt: Ecommerce Return Verification Web/App

Objective:
Create a web-based or mobile application that helps ecommerce sellers verify received return shipments by comparing input AWB numbers with an uploaded Excel sheet.

Core Functionality:
Excel Upload:

The seller uploads an Excel file with the following columns:

A: Product Details

B: Suborder ID

C: Return Reason

D: Return Shipping Fee

E: Delivered On

F: AWB Number

The application focuses primarily on column F (AWB Number) for matching purposes.

AWB Input & Real-time Verification:

After uploading the sheet, the seller can start typing AWB numbers one by one into an input field.

As soon as the seller enters at least 5 characters, the app should:

Automatically search for a match in column F.

If a match is found:

Mark that AWB number as "Received" in the internal data.

If no match is found, notify the user:

"AWB not found in uploaded list."

No submit/check button required â€“ the system checks automatically after each entry.

Final Output:

After all AWB entries are completed, the app displays a list of AWB numbers from the uploaded Excel that have not been marked as received, indicating they are missing.

User Flow Summary:
Upload Excel sheet with return data.
